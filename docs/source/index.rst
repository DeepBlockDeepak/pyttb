Python Tensor Toolbox
**********************
Tensors (also known as multidimensional arrays or N-way arrays) are used
in a variety of applications ranging from chemometrics to network
analysis.

Functionality
==============
The Python Tensor Toolbox provides the following classes and functions
for manipulating dense, sparse, and structured tensors, along with
algorithms for computing low-rank tensor models.

- `Tensor Classes`_ 

   The Python Tensor Toolbox supports multiple tensor types, including
   dense and sparse, as well as specially structured tensors, such as
   the Krusal format (stored as factor matrices).

- `Algorithms`_

   CP methods such as alternating least squares, direct optimization,
   and weighted optimization (for missing data).  Also alternative
   decompositions such as Poisson Tensor Factorization via alternating
   Poisson regression.
